# Simplex_Python

I Implemented the simplex method in Python to solve linear problems for operations research class.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
#### The way I ran this in my machine is by using a python virtual environment (venv).  The steps to set up and run a venv are bellow:
1. In the command line, in the project folder run the command:
    * `python3 -m venv simplex`
2. Once you have the venv set up, run the command:
    * `source python_env/bin/activate`
    * This command will activate the virtual environment
3. Once the venv has been activated, install the necessary modules using __pip__. I used numpy in order to achieve the simplex algorithm processing.
4. Once you've installed the module and the venv has been activated, you can run the program by executing the command:
    * `python simplex_final.py`

## This program was tested using this simplex calculator:
